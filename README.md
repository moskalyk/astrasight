# astrasight
retina scan to sky options, play money with the gods of time

Astrasight aims to harmonize the planetary heavens with market movements, particularly with ETH by creating a trading methodology and interface for market makers to learn about astrological impact on price, through acquiring the levels of wisdom behind myth-like hypotheses to timing of signifier syncronicities.

Astrasight is made with a react frontend and a worldcoin login feature. The project aims to build an interface that is easy to use for assembling market options in conjunction with planetary transitions. Currently the interface of the contract is implemented in solidity. The idea aims to combine a new erc20 token called charm, that is used to dfine options & to be paid to oracles for constructing new zodiac lore for NPCs. Due to world coin integration, this lays the potentiality for retrograde charm airdrops.
